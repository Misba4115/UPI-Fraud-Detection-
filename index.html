                    <p>How Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Works?
                        The Unified Payments Interface is a real-time payment system. It is designed to enable peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers through a single two-click factor authentication process. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank. It works by transferring money between two bank accounts along with a mobile platform.
                        UPI uses existing systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), to ensure seamless settlement across accounts. It facilitates push (pay) and pull (receive) transactions and even works for over the counter or barcode payments, as well as for multiple recurring payments such as utility bills, school fees, and other subscriptions.
                        Once a single identifier is established, the system allows mobile payments to be delivered without the use of credit or debit cards, net banking, or any need to enter account details. This would not just ensure greater safety of sensitive information, but connect people who have bank accounts via smartphones to carry out hassle-free transactions.</p>
